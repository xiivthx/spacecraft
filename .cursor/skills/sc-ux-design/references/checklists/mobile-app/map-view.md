# Map View

The native map screen showing location-based content, user position, and contextual overlays

- [ ] Pin and marker designs - Custom markers clearly distinguishable from each other and from the base map, sized for reliable tap accuracy on mobile
  - 💡 Ensure the marker design for current location is the most prominent, as all map view interactions are centred around it
- [ ] Marker clustering (if applicable) - How markers are shown when a group of them are so close together they cannot be shown individually, and must be grouped
- [ ] Native map components - Leverage either MapKit for iOS or Google Maps for Android to utilise existing foundations and layout that is time consuming to create from scratch
- [ ] Location permission - The point in the flow at which location permission is requested, with context explaining the level of access needed and why
  - 💡 Consider the UI if permissions are denied, where you can provide instructions on how to change the permission in settings
- [ ] Current location re-centre - A clearly visible button to re-centre the map to the user's current position without zooming or scrolling to it
- [ ] Selected item bottom sheet - Tapping a marker expanding a bottom sheet with details about that location - not a full-screen navigation away from the map.
- [ ] Search or filter actions - Search or filter controls accessible as a persistent overlay on the map or as a separate screen
  - 💡 Selecting filters can be on a separate screen, but when on map the applied filters should be visible for context
- [ ] Offline handling - When offline, cached map tiles displayed where available, with a clear indicator that the map may not be current
