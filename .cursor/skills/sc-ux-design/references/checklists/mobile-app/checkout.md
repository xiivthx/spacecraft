# Checkout

The payment flow on mobile optimised for native payment methods and the constraints of a small screen.

- [ ] Native payment methods - Apple Pay and Google Pay as the primary checkout options, to complete the purchase with a single biometric tap.
  - 💡 It is important to still offer manual card entry if you feel users will be concerned about 3rd part tool usage
- [ ] Persistent order summary - The item list, quantities, and total available throughout the checkout flow - either persistently visible or accessible with a single tap
- [ ] Minimal form fields - Only the fields genuinely required to complete the purchase e.g. card details, delivery address
- [ ] Autofill capabilities - Shipping address fields that support iOS and Android autofill, removing the need to type a full address manually.
- [ ] Keyboard types per field - Appropriate keyboard types throughout checkout e.g. numeric for card numbers and CVV, date or numeric pad for expiry.
- [ ] Checkout progress (state) - A clear step indicator for a multi-step experience e.g. having a Details, Payment and Checkout page separately
- [ ] Error recovery (state) - The experience after a payment failure, returning to the payment step with all previously entered data intact and a clear explanation of the reason
- [ ] Order/payment confirmation - A clear confirmation screen with summary, payment method and amount, along with any other relevant information e.g. expected arrival date if it involves physical delivery
  - 💡 It's common to email the user an invoice or payment confirmation, which the user can be reminded of here so they know they don't have to keep this page open in the app
