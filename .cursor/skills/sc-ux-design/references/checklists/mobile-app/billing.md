# Billing

Payment history, receipts, and everything related to how the user is charged.

- [ ] Manage via App Store - A link or prompt directing users to the App Store or Play Store to manage their subscription
  - 💡 Apple and Google require subscription management to happen through their platform, so a buried path there is a consistent source of support contacts and poor reviews
- [ ] Next billing date and amount - The next scheduled payment date and amount visible without needing to dig into billing history
  - 💡 Surfacing this proactively reduces cancellations driven by surprise charges
- [ ] Billing history and receipts - A list of past charges with amounts and dates, with individual receipts accessible
  - 💡 Particularly important for users paying with a work card, who often need receipts for expense reporting
- [ ] Restore purchases - A button to restore previously purchased subscriptions or in-app purchases after reinstalling or signing in on a new device
  - 💡 Required by Apple for apps with in-app purchases, since it solves the common case of reinstalling after a device change
- [ ] Refund help link - Guidance on how to request a refund, typically via the platform's own process
  - 💡 Refunds are handled by Apple or Google, not the app directly, and making this clear reduces confusion and support volume
- [ ] Tax display - Tax or VAT amounts displayed separately from the base price where legally required.
