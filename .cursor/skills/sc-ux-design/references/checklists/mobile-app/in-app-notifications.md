# In-App Notifications

The in-app feed of alerts, updates, and messages the user has received  -  distinct from system push notifications.

- [ ] Reverse chronological order - Newest notifications at the top means users don't have to scroll for the latest
- [ ] Unread indicators (state) - Unread notifications visually distinct from read ones e.g. a dot, bolder text, or a background colour difference
- [ ] Mark all as read (state) - A single action to clear all unread indicators at once
  - 💡 Essential for an app with many notifications, or where there is likelihood the user spends a long time away 
- [ ] Notification grouping - Related notifications grouped together e.g. multiple comments on the same post shown as a single expandable item, not separate rows
  - 💡 Best applied to high-activity content
- [ ] Swipe to dismiss action - Individual notifications dismissible by swiping left, revealing a delete action
- [ ] Deep link on tap - Tapping a notification navigates the user directly to the relevant content
- [ ] Empty state (state) - For when there are no notifications, to indicate they haven't received any… yet
- [ ] Settings shortcut - A direct link from the notifications screen to notification preferences, for users who want to adjust what they receive
- [ ] Notification content - Information relevant to triggering the notification e.g. the change, author and time it occurred
