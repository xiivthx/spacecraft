# Chat

The one-to-one or group messaging screen, handling keyboard behaviour, message input, media sharing, and real-time updates in the constraints of a mobile screen.

- [ ] Keyboard push-up - The message input bar rising with the keyboard when it opens, so the conversation history is not obscured
  - 💡 The behaviour differs between iOS and Android, so explicit handling on both platforms is what prevents the common bug of the keyboard obscuring the input bar
- [ ] Input bar - A persistent input bar at the bottom of the screen containing a text field, send button, and media attachment option, thumb-reachable in all grip positions
- [ ] Message bubbles (state) - Sent messages on the right, received on the left, consistent with every messaging convention the user already knows
  - 💡 Breaking the sent-right received-left convention for a design reason is rarely worth the disorientation it causes
- [ ] Swipe to reply - Swiping a message right revealing a reply-to action, threading the response to the specific message
- [ ] Long press message actions - Long pressing a message opening a reaction picker and action menu e.g. react, reply, copy, delete
- [ ] Read receipts (state) - Sent message status shown as subtle indicators below or within the message bubble (sent, delivered, read)
- [ ] Media and file sharing - Images, videos, and files shareable directly from the input bar, with inline previews in the conversation thread
- [ ] Typing indicator - An animated indicator when the other party is composing
- [ ] Scroll to latest - When new messages arrive while the user is scrolled up, a button to jump to the latest message
