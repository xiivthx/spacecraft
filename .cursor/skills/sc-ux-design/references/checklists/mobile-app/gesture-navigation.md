# Gesture navigation

The touch-based interaction patterns that let users navigate and act without tapping buttons.

- [ ] Swipe to go back - The standard action to allow a user to go back without tapping a button
  - 💡 This can be disabled on screens where a horizontal swipe exists to not be a conflict
- [ ] List item swipe actions - Revealing quick actions such as delete, archive, mark as read on an item without opening it
  - 💡 Suitable only if there are 2-3 actions available on the item, any more may be too significant space was
- [ ] Pull to refresh - For scrollable content lists with a visible indicator and haptic confirmation when triggered
- [ ] Long press menus - Triggered by long pressing, an item reveals actions relevant to that specific element
  - 💡 These are utilised for quick actions, and the action should exist elsewhere in a more accessible way in the app
- [ ] Pinch to zoom - Image and map content supporting standard pinch-to-zoom, with zoom level reset logically on navigation away
- [ ] Drag to reorder - Lists or cards that can be reordered supporting long-press-to-lift and drag, with clear visual feedback during the drag state
- [ ] Gesture hints - A subtle animation or tooltip on first encounter with a key gesture, hinting at its existence
  - 💡 If it's a significant value to learn the gesture, the hint could persist until the user tries the action, so they understand it better
- [ ] Haptic feedback - Beneficial for key gesture moments where your finger may cover the screen and therefore it's not clear whether you have engaged with the gesture e.g. the pull-to-refresh, long press or drag actions
