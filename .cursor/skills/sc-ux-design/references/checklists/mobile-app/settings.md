# Settings

The screen where users manage their account, preferences, notifications, and app behaviour.

- [ ] Grouped table layout - Settings organised into clearly labelled sections (Account, Notifications, Privacy, Support) using the native grouped list pattern
  - 💡 Grouped settings are a platform convention users have deeply internalised. Deviating from it forces users to relearn navigation they already know
- [ ] Native toggle controls - Binary settings presented with the platform-native toggle switch (UISwitch on iOS, Material Switch on Android)
  - 💡 Custom toggles that look slightly off from the native ones create subtle distrust, since the difference is small but users notice it
- [ ] Destructive actions grouped - Log out, delete account, and other irreversible actions in their own section at the bottom, visually distinguished in red
- [ ] Account details at top - The user's avatar, name, and email shown prominently at the top of settings, a clear anchor for whose account is being managed
- [ ] Deep link to specific settings - A direct link from relevant in-app prompts to the specific settings screen they reference - notification preferences, privacy, and so on.
  - 💡 Telling users where to find a setting is far less effective than linking them there directly.
- [ ] Support and feedback access - A clear path to contact support, submit feedback, or access help documentation, accessible from within settings.
- [ ] App version - The current app version shown at the bottom of settings - essential for support conversations and identifying build-specific issues.
- [ ] Legal links - Links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service accessible within settings, as required by app stores.
