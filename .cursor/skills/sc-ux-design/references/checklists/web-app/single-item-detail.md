# Single Item Detail

A screen that displays the full details of a single record  -  a user, order, document, or any other entity  -  after selecting it from a list.

- [ ] Clear title or identifier - The name, ID, or primary label of the item, shown prominently at the top of the screen
- [ ] Status indicator (if applicable) - A clear signal of the item's current state (active, pending, completed, archived)
  - 💡 Colour-blind users can't distinguish status by colour alone, so include a text label alongside the colour indicator to ensure it's readable
- [ ] Key details section - The most important attributes of the item surfaced prominently, with secondary details available below or in a sidebar
  - 💡 It's critical to exercise hierarchy here and consider what details matter more than others, and how can they be effectively grouped
- [ ] Edit action - A clear way to modify the item's details, either inline or via an edit mode
- [ ] Related items or activity - Associated records, linked content, or a history of changes related to this item
  - 💡 An activity log showing who did what and when is highly valued in collaborative products
- [ ] Breadcrumb or back navigation - A way to return to the list or parent context
- [ ] Destructive actions - Delete or archive options, available on the detail screen but kept visually separate from the primary actions
