# Color System

The color layer of a design system  -  defining a palette that is purposeful, accessible, themeable, and expressed as tokens rather than raw values.

- [ ] Primitive palette - A base set of named color ramps (blue-100 through blue-900, neutral-0 through neutral-1000) that serves as the raw material for all semantic decisions
  - 💡 Systems where components reference primitive values directly are significantly harder to theme  -  a color change requires updating each component individually rather than a single token definition
- [ ] Semantic color tokens - Named tokens that describe purpose rather than appearance so the system can be reskinned without touching components e.g. color-background-primary, color-text-danger, color-border-interactive
  - 💡 The semantic layer is what makes a design system actually themeable by defining purpose for colors
- [ ] Interactive state colors - Defined color values for default, hover, pressed, focused, disabled, and selected states applied consistently across all interactive elements
- [ ] Feedback colors (state) - A consistent set of colors for success, warning, error, and informational states - used across alerts, form validation, badges, and status indicators.
  - 💡 Feedback colors that pass contrast in light mode frequently fail in dark mode  -  testing each token pair against every surface in both themes is where most gaps tend to surface.
- [ ] Contrast ratios (accessibility) - A breakdown of text and interactive element color combinations verified to meet WCAG AA contrast minimums - 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
  - 💡 Not all colors will pair together nicely so defining this for all usage is helpful
- [ ] Dark and light mode definition - A complete parallel set of semantic token values for the opposite mode
  - 💡 It is not as simple as inverting colors of one mode to the other, they require their own system (still using the same primitive colors though)
- [ ] Brand color integration - Brand colors mapped into the semantic system in a way that maintains accessibility
  - 💡 Where brand values fall below contrast thresholds, they are restricted to decorative contexts, with accessible token values carrying the text and interactive roles.
- [ ] Color blindness considerations - The palette tested against common color vision deficiencies for when color is used to convey state
  - 💡 It's worthwhile considering relative items to the color if vision is a concern, meaning an icon or text can help further convey a state incase the color is not successfully visible
