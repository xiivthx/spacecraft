# Drawer

A drawer is a panel that slides in from the edge, overlaying content. It provides access to detailed information without completely navigating away from the current page.

- [ ] Placement - Which edge the drawer slides from - most commonly from left (navigation) or right (details/settings)
- [ ] Dimensions - Typically full height, but width can vary. Should be wide enough for complex content to be shown, without taking over the entire page
- [ ] Overlay - A semi-transparent background for the remaining screen area to bring focus to the drawer
- [ ] Header - Top section with a title describing drawer contents or purpose, along with a close action (optional)
  - 💡 Can also include a description of drawer contents if header is too simple
- [ ] Content area - Main section, which should be scrollable if content exceeds window height
- [ ] Open and close trigger - How user activate the drawer - typically a button to open, while closing can have multiple ways: clicking overlay, a close button, or pressing Esc on keyboard should all be active options
- [ ] Footer - Fixed area at the bottom for actions, usually a primary and secondary e.g. Save & Cancel
