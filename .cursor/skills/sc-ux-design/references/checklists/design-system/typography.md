# Typography

The type layer of a design system that defines a scale, hierarchy, and set of text styles that is consistent, accessible, and expressive across the full range of product contexts

- [ ] Type scale - A defined set of font sizes with a consistent ratio between them, covering everything from captions to display headings
  - 💡 A modular scale (1.25, 1.333, 1.5 ratio) produces a more harmonious hierarchy than arbitrary size choices
- [ ] Semantic text styles - Named styles that describe role rather than size so usage is driven by meaning, not pixel values e.g. display-large, body-default, label-small, caption
  - 💡 Style names chosen by size  -  24px, 18px, 14px  -  consistently result in designers selecting styles by measurement rather than role, which makes the system harder to evolve when the scale changes.
- [ ] Typeface selection and loading (state) - The chosen typefaces detailing style and weight e.g. Inclusive Sans Medium
- [ ] Line height per style - Line height defined explicitly for every text style since tightly spaced headings and readable body text require different values
  - 💡 Similar style groups follow a consistent line height e.g. 1.5 for body text, 1.2 for heading and 1.1 for display
- [ ] Letter spacing per style - Letter spacing defined per style where needed
  - 💡 Similar to line height, where style groups often following a consistent pattern
- [ ] Responsive type behaviour - How text styles respond to viewport size, whether through fluid type scaling, breakpoint-based overrides, or fixed sizes with responsive layout compensation
- [ ] Minimum readable size - The smallest text size in use across the system, and how readability at that size is validated in the actual rendering environment
  - 💡 Consider minimum size between desktop and mobile differently
- [ ] Accessibility responsiveness - How text styles behave at 200% browser zoom, and whether any style communicates meaning through colour variation alone
