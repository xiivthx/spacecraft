# Dropdown Menu

A dropdown triggered from a button or right-click target to reveal a menu of actions the user can proceed with

- [ ] Trigger affordance - The element that opens the menu: an overflow icon, chevron button, or right-click target
- [ ] Menu item anatomy - The structure of each action: label, optional leading icon, optional trailing shortcut, optional destructive styling
  - 💡 Mixing icon and non-icon items in the same list throws off the scan
- [ ] Section dividers and groups - Dividers and/or labels that break related actions into sections once the menu gets large
- [ ] Destructive item styling - Visual differentiation - typically the danger colour - for actions that cannot be undone
  - 💡 Always place destructive actions at the end of the menu, after a divider to reduce misclicks
- [ ] Nested submenu - A secondary menu triggered by a parent item, used for grouping related but distinct actions
  - 💡 Limit nesting to one level to be too layered and confusing
- [ ] Disabled items - Menu items that are visible but cannot be triggered, indicating an unavailable action
  - 💡 A tooltip on that item that reveals the reason it is disabled is handy
- [ ] Positioning and overflow - The menu's placement relative to its trigger, repositioning automatically to stay within the viewport
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut display - Shortcut hints aligned to the trailing edge of the item label
