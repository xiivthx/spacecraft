# Carousel

A carousel is a slideshow component that displays content one slide at a time. Users can alternate content through manual navigation or waiting for automatic transition.

- [ ] Ways of interaction - Defining whether the carousel transitions are auto-play, navigated by controls, or both
- [ ] Visual progress indicator (state) - Show dots, numbers, or a progress bar so users know how many slides there are and which one they're currently viewing.
  - 💡 Make the current slide's indicator look noticeably different so people can track their position at a glance.
- [ ] Dimensions and alignment - The size of the items in the carousel, and their responsiveness across devices.
  - 💡 Decide how content sits inside the item container so that it is filling the required space without being stretched or not looking uniform.
- [ ] Animation behaviour - The direction, speed and feeling of how the items transition between each other.
- [ ] Focused item state - if your carousel shows one item a time, the one on focus should appear different to the items that are entering and exiting
  - 💡 Size, transparency and colour are typical properties to change on the non-focused items to allow the focused have more attention naturally
