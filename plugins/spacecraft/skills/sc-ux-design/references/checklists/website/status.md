# Status

- [ ] Component status list - Each major service or component (API, dashboard, integrations, notifications) shown with its current operational state
  - 💡 A single 'All systems operational' row on its own is less useful than per-component status, since users experiencing an issue with one part of the product need to know if it is on their end or yours
- [ ] Live incident updates - During an active incident, timestamped updates posted in sequence (identifying the issue, confirming investigation, and reporting resolution)
  - 💡 The cadence of updates matters more than their length  -  a brief 'investigating' post every 30 minutes is far more reassuring than silence followed by an explanation
- [ ] Incident history - An archive of past incidents with dates, duration, affected components, and a brief post-mortem
- [ ] Uptime metrics - Historical uptime percentages per component, typically covering a rolling 90-day window
- [ ] Scheduled maintenance - Upcoming planned maintenance windows listed in advance with estimated duration and which components will be affected
  - 💡 Scheduled maintenance announced at least 72 hours in advance (and communicated via the subscription channel) is far better absorbed than a surprise
- [ ] Subscribe to updates - An email, SMS, or webhook subscription option so users are notified of incidents without having to check the page themselves
- [ ] Separate domain - The status page hosted on a domain independent of the main infrastructure, so it remains accessible when the product itself is down
  - 💡 A status page that goes offline during an outage is the single most common implementation failure. A separate hosting arrangement is the only reliable solution
