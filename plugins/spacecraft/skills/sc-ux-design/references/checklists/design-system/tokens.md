# Tokens

The layer of a design system where defined variables are outlined across the platform to enable consistency, theming and alignment with code.

- [ ] Three-tier token architecture - Tokens organised into primitive, semantic, and component tiers - primitives store raw values, semantic tokens describe purpose, component tokens scope decisions to a specific element
  - 💡 It's okay to start with just primitives and component tokens first, and only utilise semantic for theming
- [ ] Naming convention - A consistent, predictable naming pattern so any token name communicates its purpose without needing documentation.
  - 💡 A token named blue-500 tells you the value, but a token named color-interactive-primary-default tells you when and where to use it, making that system the scalable one
- [ ] Token documentation - Each semantic token documented with its intended use, example contexts, and what it can and cannot be used for
- [ ] Token governance - A clear rule for what constitutes a token versus a hardcoded value, and a process for reviewing and approving new tokens before they are added to the system
  - 💡 New tokens should always be suggested, but have clear reasoning of purpose and scalable use to be genuinely considered
- [ ] Design tool sync - Tokens maintained in your design tool of choice as variables
  - 💡 Aim to find a way to connect your tokens to what is in code  -  naming convention being 1:1 is ideal for ongoing maintenance
- [ ] Versioning and changelog - Token changes versioned and communicated in a way that teams consuming the token system can know when values change and what the impact will be on their surfaces
