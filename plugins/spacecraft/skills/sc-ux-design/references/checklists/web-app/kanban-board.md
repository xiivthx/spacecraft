# Kanban board

A visual board that organises items into columns representing stages or statuses, allowing users to track and move work through a workflow.

- [ ] Columns (state) - Distinct vertical lanes representing each stage of the workflow (To Do, In Progress, Done, or custom stages)
  - 💡 Every team structures their workflow differently, so adding, renaming, and reordering columns should be available
- [ ] Cards - Individual items displayed within each column, showing the title and key metadata at a glance
  - 💡 Title, assignee, and due date on the card face covers most use cases without cluttering
- [ ] Drag and drop - The ability to move cards between columns and reorder them within a column by dragging
  - 💡 A visual drop target as the card is dragged to indicate whereWithout it, users are never sure where the card will land
- [ ] Quick add card - A fast way to create a new card directly within a column without opening a full form
- [ ] Card detail on click - Clicking a card opening its full detail - description, comments, attachments, history - without leaving the board.
  - 💡 Card detail in a side panel or modal rather than navigating away  -  losing the board context frustrates users.
- [ ] Column item count - A count of how many cards are in each column, visible in the column header
  - 💡 A count is useful for conversations and to keep track of column amount without individually counting items
- [ ] Filtering, sorting and grouping - The ability to re-organise cards by assignee, label, priority, or due date to focus on a subset of work, as an example
