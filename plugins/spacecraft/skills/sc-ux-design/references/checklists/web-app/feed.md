# Feed

A stream of content, activity, or updates that users scroll through to stay informed.

- [ ] Feed item preview - A preview of each feed item (title, excerpt, or thumbnail) sufficient to judge whether the item is worth opening
  - 💡 Variable-height items force the eye to re-adjust between each card whereas a consistent layout makes items harder to differentiate
- [ ] Author - The name and avatar of the person who created or posted each item
  - 💡 Linking the author name to their profile is a natural interaction expectation in most social or collaborative contexts
- [ ] Timestamps - When each item was published or last updated
  - 💡 Relative time works well for recent items, but eventually it should switch to the exact date and time
- [ ] Engagement actions - Ways to interact with feed items (like, comment, share, save, or react)
  - 💡 Consider size of every interaction in terms of prominence and frequency of use
- [ ] New content indicator - A banner or button that appears when new items have been posted since the user loaded the feed
  - 💡 Auto-injecting new posts while the user is reading pushes existing content down and makes scrolling janky
- [ ] Filtering - Controls for narrowing the feed to a specific category, content type, or followed accounts
  - 💡 Always indicate when filters are active for users to understand why specific content may or may not be shown
- [ ] Pagination or infinite scroll (state) - A mechanism for loading more items as the user reaches the bottom of the feed
  - 💡 Pagination is suited well for work-related apps that have extensive databases
- [ ] Empty state (state) - The state shown when the feed has no items to display whether due to no connections, no activity, or an empty filter result
  - 💡 A first-use empty state can point towards a specific action e.g. follow people, create a post, invite a colleague
