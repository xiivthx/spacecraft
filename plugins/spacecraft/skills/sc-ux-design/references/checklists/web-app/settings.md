# Settings

A screen that gives users control over their account, preferences, and application behaviour

- [ ] Structure - Organising settings controls into logical categories e.g. account, notifications, security, billing.
  - 💡 Consider elevating the most commonly changed settings rather than the most important
- [ ] Account details - The fields where users update their name, email address, and profile photo
- [ ] Security details - The ability to change the password, two-factor authentication and other security information
  - 💡 These fields should require re-authentication to save changes
- [ ] Notification preferences - Controls for which notifications the user receives and through which channel, grouped by type (product updates, reminders, billing)
  - 💡 Grouping by type and/or platform helps reduce the chances of a user disabling all notifications rather than some
- [ ] Billing - Managing payment method, upgrading or cancelling a payment - this could also be a preview of this information with a link directly to the billing page if separate
- [ ] Additional preferences (if applicable) - Language, timezone, date format, and appearance settings like dark mode
- [ ] Danger zone - Destructive actions like account deletion, clearly separated from the rest of settings
  - 💡 Include a confirmation step for any destructive actions, with details on what will be lost if the user continues
