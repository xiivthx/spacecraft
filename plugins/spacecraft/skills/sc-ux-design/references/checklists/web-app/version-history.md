# Version History

A screen outlining different versions of an item or experience that you can navigate between.

- [ ] Version timeline (state) - A list of saved versions in reverse chronological order, each labelled with a timestamp and the user who saved it
- [ ] Named versions - The ability to give a version a name (a milestone, a submission date, a phase label) so it is findable without scrolling through timestamps
  - 💡 Autosave versions are useful for recovery, but named versions are what users actually navigate by, so making both available covers both use cases
- [ ] Version preview - A read-only preview of any past version, visible without committing to a restore
- [ ] Diff or change summary - A visual indication of what changed between two versions (added, removed, or modified content)
  - 💡 A diff view reduces the time it takes to evaluate whether a version is the right one to restore
- [ ] Restore action - A clear way to make a past version the current one, with a confirmation step that sets expectations about what will happen to the current content
- [ ] Autosave indicator (state) - A persistent, subtle indicator of when the document was last saved automatically, visible without being disruptive
