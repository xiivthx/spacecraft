# Chat

A screen for real-time or asynchronous messaging between users, either one-on-one or in a group context.

- [ ] Message thread - A chronological display of messages in the conversation, with the most recent at the bottom
  - 💡 Auto-scrolling to the latest message on load is expected, but scrolling up to read history should never be interrupted by new messages arriving
- [ ] Message input - A text field for composing and sending messages, with support for multi-line input
  - 💡 Multi-line input is often defined with Shift + Enter, with just Enter alone triggering the message to be sent
- [ ] Sender identification - The sender's name and avatar displayed alongside each message, making the conversation easy to follow
  - 💡 Consecutive messages from the same sender typically don't need repeated name and avatar, so grouping them reduces visual clutter
- [ ] Timestamps (state) - When each message was sent, using relative time for recent messages and a full timestamp for older ones
- [ ] Read receipts - An indicator showing whether the other participant has seen a message.
  - 💡 Not all users want this level of visibility into their activity  -  read receipts are worth making optional where the product allows.
- [ ] File and media sharing - The ability to attach images, files, or links within the conversation, and show those attachments within the conversation
- [ ] Reactions - Emoji reactions on individual messages as a lightweight way to respond without sending a full reply
