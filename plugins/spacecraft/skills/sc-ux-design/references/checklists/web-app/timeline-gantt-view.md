# Timeline / Gantt View

A screen that displays tasks, milestones, or events along a horizontal time axis, commonly used in project management products to show schedules and dependencies.

- [ ] Time axis - A horizontal axis representing time, with clear date markers (days, weeks, or months depending on the zoom level)
  - 💡 A timeline locked to a single timescale rarely fits all project sizes, and zoom controls let users shift between day, week, and month views as needed
- [ ] Task bars - Horizontal bars representing each task or milestone, positioned according to their start and end dates
  - 💡 A monochrome timeline becomes hard to parse at a glance  -  colouring bars by status, assignee, or category makes patterns visible immediately
- [ ] Dependencies - Visual connectors between tasks that must be completed in sequence, showing which items are blocked by others
  - 💡 Dependency lines can visually overwhelm a busy timeline, so showing them on hover or when a task is selected keeps the default view readable
- [ ] Today indicator - A vertical line marking the current date so users can immediately see what is on track and what is overdue
- [ ] Milestones - Distinct markers for key dates or deliverables that are not duration-based tasks
- [ ] Drag to reschedule - The ability to move or resize task bars by dragging to update dates directly on the timeline
  - 💡 A date tooltip while dragging gives users precise feedback on the new start and end dates
- [ ] Row grouping - The ability to organise tasks by assignee, team, project phase, or another dimension
