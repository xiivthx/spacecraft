# Empty State

The state of a screen or component when there is no data to display, whether it's because a user is new, has cleared their content, or a search returned no results.

- [ ] Illustration or icon - A visual that signals the empty state and gives the screen some personality, rather than feeling broken
  - 💡 Visual should be contextual e.g. empty inbox and a deleted account shouldn't be the same
- [ ] Clear heading - A short, plain-language title naming what's missing
  - 💡 'It's empty' isn't helpful while 'No projects yet' is clear
- [ ] Supporting description - A brief explanation of what belongs in this space, most useful for first-time users
- [ ] Primary action - A CTA pointing toward the next step: creating, importing, connecting etc
  - 💡 It should create the first item, not just link somewhere generic
- [ ] Zero state vs. no-results state (state) - A distinction between a screen that is empty because nothing has been created versus one that returned no search or filter results
  - 💡 A no-results state without a way to reset or broaden the search is a dead end - always provide an escape route
- [ ] Error state variant (state) - A separate variant for when content failed to load, as opposed to genuinely being empty
  - 💡 Showing an empty state when the real issue is a loading error causes users to assume they have lost their data
