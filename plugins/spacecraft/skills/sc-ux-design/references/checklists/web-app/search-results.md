# Search Results

Displaying and navigating results matching a user's query from within the product.

- [ ] Search input - A search field at the top of the results, pre-filled with the current query so it can be refined without starting over
- [ ] Result count - How many results were found for the query
  - 💡 Show it even at zero as it tells the user the search ran, not that something broke
- [ ] Result items - Each result shown with enough to identify it - title, type, image, and a snippet of the matching content
  - 💡 Highlighting the matched term in the snippet confirms
- [ ] Result type indicators - A label or icon marking what kind of item each result is (document, person, project, message)
- [ ] Filters - The ability to narrow results by category, date, status, or other relevant values
- [ ] No results state - The state shown when a query returns no matches, ideally with suggestions for what to try instead
  - 💡 Offer alternatives instead of a blank space, whether it's a suggested query or spelling change
- [ ] Recent searches (state) - A list of the user's previous queries, shown when the search field is focused but empty
