# Analytics

A live dashboard that surfaces key metrics and trends, helping users understand what is happening right now.

- [ ] Date range selector - A date picker with shortcuts for today, last 7 days, last 30 days, this month, and custom range
  - 💡 Keyboard entry for custom date ranges is valued, to avoid extensive clicking through months and years
- [ ] Headline metrics - The most important numbers displayed as prominent headline figures
  - 💡 These metrics are often described as 'snapshots', meaning by looking at them you get a snapshot of how the content the analytics is representing is performing
- [ ] Charts with labels and axes - Visualisations with clearly labelled axes, a legend where needed, and readable tick marks
- [ ] Period comparison - A percentage or absolute change indicator showing how each metric has moved relative to the prior period
  - 💡 A percentage is valuable for larger values, with absolute numbers suiting lower values
- [ ] Segment breakdown - The ability to slice a metric by properties e.g. channel, device, geography, or another attribute
  - 💡 Quick select breakdowns based on popular selections are a thoughtful shortcut 
- [ ] Last updated indicator - A visible timestamp or refresh button showing when the data was last updated (if it is not automatically refreshing)
- [ ] Loading and empty states (state) - Skeleton loaders while data is fetching, and a contextual message when no data exists for the selected range
  - 💡 'No data for this period' with a suggestion to adjust the range is more useful than a blank screen
