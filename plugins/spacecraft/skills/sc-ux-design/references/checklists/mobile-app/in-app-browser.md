# In-App Browser

A browser experience inside a mobile app, which is handy for opening web links or accessing web data via API.

- [ ] URL bar visibility - The URL of the current page visible to the user, confirming the domain before they interact with any forms or enter credentials
  - 💡 Users who cannot see the URL in an in-app browser cannot verify they are on a legitimate domain, since URL visibility is a security baseline
- [ ] Close action - A clear, persistent button for closing the browser and returning to the app (typically in a fixed toolbar rather than hidden behind a gesture)
- [ ] Open in external default browser action - An option to open the URL in the user's default browser, while preserving the in-app browser experience still
- [ ] Share action - Allowing the URL to be shared without opening the default browser
- [ ] Loading feedback (state) - A progress indicator while the page loads (either a top progress bar or an activity indicator) so the user knows the browser is working
