# Invite

The flow for adding collaborators or members to a shared space with role assignment and pending invite management.

- [ ] Email invite - The primary method of inviting someone by entering their email address directly
- [ ] Role or permission selection - A control for setting what the invited person will be able to see and do once they accept
  - 💡 Show what each role can and cannot do before the invite is sent, since this prevents over-permissioning and the back-and-forth of revoking access later. Keep roles to three or fewer where possible
- [ ] Contact picker - Access to the device's contacts list for finding people to invite without typing a full address
  - 💡 On iOS this requires explicit permission. Prime the user with a custom screen before the system prompt, since 'Find people you already know' performs better than asking cold
- [ ] Bulk invite - A way to add multiple people at once, by entering several addresses or pasting a list
  - 💡 Support comma-separated and line-break-separated input, since users are likely to paste from spreadsheets or threads
- [ ] Pending invites + actions (state) - A list of sent invitations that have not yet been accepted, with the option to resend or revoke each one
  - 💡 Show when each invite was sent and when it expires for context on most recent invite sent
- [ ] Shareable invite link - A link that grants access to anyone who opens it, with a configurable permission level
  - 💡 Include an expiry option and a usage limit on the link for security
- [ ] Seat or member limit - A visible count of remaining available seats, surfaced before the user reaches the plan's member cap
- [ ] Access scope summary - A clear statement of what the invited person will be able to see and do, shown to the sender before confirming
