# Action Sheet

The sheet that slides up from the bottom of the screen to present options or confirmations  -  the mobile equivalent of a dropdown menu or modal dialog.

- [ ] Heading and actions - Similar to modals, there must be a clear heading outline the purpose of the action sheet, along with relevant actions the user can select to continue
- [ ] Swipe or backdrop dismiss - The sheet is dismissible by dragging it down or tapping the dimmed area behind it, along with the expected close button
- [ ] Destructive action styling - Any destructive option - delete, remove, block - styled in red and positioned last, separated from safe actions.
  - 💡 Users scan top-to-bottom and tap quickly  -  a destructive action buried at the bottom prevents accidental taps.
- [ ] Cancel action - A clearly labelled cancel/close option that dismisses the sheet without taking any action
  - 💡 Typically the secondary action, similar to a desktop modal
- [ ] Snap points (if expandable) - Defining where the action sheet expands or compresses to on resize, instead of it being free-form
  - 💡 A drag handle at the top of the sheet indicates the action sheet can be expanded (or dismissed)
- [ ] Content scrollability - Consider what stickies as you scroll so the sheet remains contextual, and that the sheet stays fixed in position on scroll
  - 💡 Similar to modals, it's best to avoid scrollability here unless you cannot avoid it
- [ ] Keyboard relation - Consider the action sheet size and responsiveness if keyboard needs to be triggered while it is active
- [ ] Backdrop dimming - The screen behind darkened to draw focus to the action sheet
