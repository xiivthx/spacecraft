# Search

The search experience on mobile where keyboard handling and filtering results are unique to web.

- [ ] Sticky search bar - The search input fixed at the top of the screen as results scroll beneath it
  - 💡 A search bar that scrolls away with results forces users to scroll back up if they need to refine their query
- [ ] Keyboard auto-focus - The keyboard opens immediately when the user navigates to the search screen - no extra tap required to start typing
- [ ] Live results - Results updating as the user types rather than requiring a submit tap
- [ ] Recent searches - Previously searched terms shown before the user starts typing for convenience to revisit results
- [ ] Filter bottom sheet - Filtering accessed via a bottom sheet rather than a separate screen, to keep the search context visible while adjusting
  - 💡 A full-screen filter page can be better if the filtering is extensive e.g. a retail store or booking system
- [ ] Skeleton loading (state) - Skeleton cards in the expected result shape shown while results load as user types
- [ ] No results state (state) - A helpful empty state with suggestions e.g. suggestion to check spelling, remove filters or try related terms
- [ ] Clear query button - An action inside or near the search field to clear the current query with one tap
